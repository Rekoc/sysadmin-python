Legolas and Gimli advanced on the orcs, raising their weapons with a harrowing war cry.
Immediately the orcs began to attack with more cunning and viciousness than before, easily breaking through the front line of defense.
As they were about to make another charge, Tullius strode into the battle from the flank, returning the dwarves’ previous success.
Soon only one battle-dead corpse was left on the ground as the orcs scrambled away in fear.
With a grin, he turned to his companions.
“Well done, my friends.
The fight seems to have gotten the attention of the enemy and it looks as if we will be able to hunt this lot down without the need for further bloodshed.
They will be running for their lives soon!
Here is where I will hand over the captives to you.
Shall we do the honors?”
The party was astonished to see that all the orcs were making a last-ditch effort to stand and fight.
They had been fighting far longer than the hobbits expected.
Legolas and Gimli charged the orcs with savage ferocity, swords flashing in the sunlight.
